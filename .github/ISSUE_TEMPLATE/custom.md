<!-- Hello! Thanks for your interest. 

I (@donaldguy) have enabled issues on this fork ~per request, but at this time I am not strongly intending to address issues filed unless they affect me personally (and not even always then).

Other people are welcome to file PRs and I'll do my best to review. That said,

At the time of this writing (early November 2021), the upstream maintainer (@koekeishiya) has an M1 Pro on the way (expected 11/11) and targeting upstream support for Monterey when he can get to it, off the `the-future` branch of their repo:

https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/issues/725#issuecomment-949484389
https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/issues/923#issuecomment-956198083

This fork may very well go away / be archived once that happens. So if you want to make a durable impact on the yabai project, this is probably not the right target (work here should be seen as ... ~pluperfect backporting)
